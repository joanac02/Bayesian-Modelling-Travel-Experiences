# Bayesian-Modelling-Travel-Experiences
 
* Tourism in Portugal is a source of growth and innovation for the Portuguese business community fabric. As such, this in-depth analysis of the article "Dataset for understanding why people share their travel experiences on social media: Structural equation model analysis".

* The data used was extracted between June and July 2017 and consists of a set of questions asked to Portuguese users of the social network Facebook, addressing their sharing online experiences about travel. In the article, the authors use a structural equation model based on partial least squares equation.

* This work will adopt a Bayesian approach based on maximum likelihood estimation, in an attempt to robustly perceive the relationships between latent and observed variables. Thus, the motivations of the respondents will be studied in terms of their publications and consultations related to tourism, going into detail on a personal level, security, among others.

* The ultimate goal is to gather information that can help improve the experience of both visitors to the country and the residents who welcome them and live in a multicultural environment.
